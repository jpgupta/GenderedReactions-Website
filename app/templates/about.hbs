        <h3>What the data means</h3>

        <p>
            The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates over-the-counter and prescription drugs in the United
            States. An adverse event may be submitted to the FDA to report any undesirable experiences associated with
            the use of a medical product in a patient. The dataset used in this website is sourced openly from the The
            FDA&nbsp;Adverse Drug Reaction reporting system. These reports are submitted by patients and doctors when
            they experience a potential side effect after starting new medication. GenderedReactions.com allows the user
            to locate a drug (by generic name or American brand name) which has been already evaluated by the FDA. The
            data is then sorted to indicate if there is a gender disparity in the symptoms and side effects of any given
            product.</p>
